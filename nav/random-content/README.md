# random-content-page
The purpose of this project is to satisfy the desire to host a selection of content that is presented in a random sequence when viewed. We will be using a standard webpage using an iFrame, the source of which will update periodically to a randomly selected source stored in an array.<br>
index.html - contains a simple iFrame<br>
index.css - styles the index file to be responsive based on view window<br>
index.js - contains the functions to randomly select new src for the iFrame<br>
array.js - contains the array of sources so that when adding new content or removing stale content this is the only file that will need to be updated.<br>
